     * Task: Implement a function that uses the user input to calculate a value doing
     *       any operation you want. The function should return whatever datatype you desire,
     *       but it is automatically set as a double.
     *       
     * Goal: Discuss with your teammmates any changes that you make. Push your changes to YOUR BRANCH in the repository,
     *       create a merge request, and merge the changes to the main branch after reviewing the code with your team
     *       and discussing any changes needed.
     *       
     *       As a team, review each person's merge request and discuss any changes that need to be made based on the slides
     *       and tips provided for good code reviews.
