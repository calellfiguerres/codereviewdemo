# CS322 Code Reviews

## Getting started

This project will be cloned by teams of ~4 and will require active collaboration, discussion, and effort from
all members.

Follow the code reviews checklist and properly review each person's merge request upon creation
of a merge request. There should be **ONE** main person who reviews your code and approves the merge request,
but any team member can comment and make suggestions for improvement.
